	abstract = {This systematic analysis aimed to investigate the value of microRNA-21 (miR-21) in colorectal cancer for multiple purposes, including diagnosis and prognosis, as well as its predictive power in combination biomarkers. Fifty-seven eligible studies were included in our meta-analysis, including 25 studies for diagnostic meta-analysis and 32 for prognostic meta-analysis. For the diagnostic meta-analysis of miR-21 alone, the overall pooled results for sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were 0.64 (95\% CI: 0.53-0.74), 0.85 (0.79-0.90), and 0.85 (0.81-0.87), respectively. Circulating samples presented corresponding values of 0.72 (0.63-0.79), 0.84 (0.78-0.89), and 0.86 (0.83-0.89), respectively. For the diagnostic meta-analysis of miR-21-related combination biomarkers, the above three parameters were 0.79 (0.69-0.86), 0.79 (0.68-0.87), and 0.86 (0.83-0.89), respectively. Notably, subgroup analysis suggested that miRNA combination markers in circulation exhibited high predictive power, with sensitivity of 0.85 (0.70-0.93), specificity of 0.86 (0.77-0.92), and AUC of 0.92 (0.89-0.94). For the prognostic meta-analysis, patients with higher expression of miR-21 had significant shorter disease-free survival [DFS; pooled hazard ratio (HR): 1.60; 95\% CI: 1.20-2.15] and overall survival (OS; 1.54; 1.27-1.86). The combined HR in tissues for DFS and OS were 1.76 (1.31-2.36) and 1.58 (1.30-1.93), respectively. Our comprehensive systematic review revealed that circulating miR-21 may be suitable as a diagnostic biomarker, while tissue miR-21 could be a prognostic marker for colorectal cancer. In addition, miRNA combination biomarkers may provide a new approach for clinical application.},

The CBD with the credible contents as a powerful and time-saving tool provide more comprehensive and accurate information for further CRC biomarker research. The CBD was constructed under MySQL server. HTML, PHP and JavaScript languages have been used to implement the web interface. The Apache was selected as HTTP server. All of these web operations were implemented under the Windows system. The CBD could provide to users the multiple individual biomarker information and categorized into the biological category, source and application of biomarkers; the experiment methods, results, authors and publication resources; the research region, the average age of cohort, gender, race, the number of tumours, tumour location and stage. We only collect data from the articles with clear and credible results to prove the biomarkers are useful in the diagnosis, treatment or prognosis of CRC. The CBD can also provide a professional platform to researchers who are interested in CRC research to communicate, exchange their research ideas and further design high-quality research in CRC.

	abstract = {Colon cancer is one of the major causes of cancer death worldwide. The five-year survival rate for the early-stage patients is more than 90\%, and only around 10\% for the later stages. Moreover, half of the colon cancer patients have been clinically diagnosed at the later stages. It is; therefore, of importance to enhance the ability for the early diagnosis of colon cancer. Taking advantages from our previous studies, there are several potential biomarkers which have been associated with the early diagnosis of the colon cancer. In order to investigate these early diagnostic biomarkers for colon cancer, human chromogranin-A (CHGA) was further analyzed among the most powerful diagnostic biomarkers. In this study, we used a logistic regression-based meta-analysis to clarify associations of CHGA expression with colon cancer diagnosis. Both healthy populations and the normal mucosa from the colon cancer patients were selected as the double normal controls. The results showed decreased expression of CHGA in the early stages of colon cancer as compared to the normal controls. The decline of CHGA expression in the early stages of colon cancer is probably a new diagnostic biomarker for colon cancer diagnosis with high predicting possibility and verification performance. We have also compared the diagnostic powers of CHGA expression with the typical oncogene KRAS, classic tumor suppressor TP53, and well-known cellular proliferation index MKI67, and the CHGA showed stronger ability to predict early diagnosis for colon cancer than these other cancer biomarkers. In the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, CHGA was revealed to share some common pathways with KRAS and TP53. CHGA might be considered as a novel, promising, and powerful biomarker for early diagnosis of colon cancer.},

	abstract = {Aim To develop a deep learning (DL) model that predicts age from fundus images (retinal age) and to investigate the association between retinal age gap (retinal age predicted by DL model minus chronological age) and mortality risk.
Methods A total of 80 169 fundus images taken from 46 969 participants in the UK Biobank with reasonable quality were included in this study. Of these, 19 200 fundus images from 11 052 participants without prior medical history at the baseline examination were used to train and validate the DL model for age prediction using fivefold cross-validation. A total of 35 913 of the remaining 35 917 participants had available mortality data and were used to investigate the association between retinal age gap and mortality.
Results The DL model achieved a strong correlation of 0.81 (p{\textless}0·001) between retinal age and chronological age, and an overall mean absolute error of 3.55 years. Cox regression models showed that each 1 year increase in the retinal age gap was associated with a 2\% increase in risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR)=1.02, 95\% CI 1.00 to 1.03, p=0.020) and a 3\% increase in risk of cause-specific mortality attributable to non-cardiovascular and non-cancer disease (HR=1.03, 95\% CI 1.00 to 1.05, p=0.041) after multivariable adjustments. No significant association was identified between retinal age gap and cardiovascular- or cancer-related mortality.
Conclusions Our findings indicate that retinal age gap might be a potential biomarker of ageing that is closely related to risk of mortality, implying the potential of retinal image as a screening tool for risk stratification and delivery of tailored interventions.},

This meta-analysis aims to estimate the overall diagnostic accuracy of blood-based circulating miRNAs for leukemia. Methods: We searched multiple databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wan Fang Data and CQVIP) up to June 18, 2015. Results:32 studies from 10 publications were included in this meta-analysis. Diagnostic capacity was evaluated by pooled sensitivity, specifIcity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) through random-effects model. Sensitivity analyses were sequentially performed to find potential sources of heterogeneity. The quality of included studies was assessed by QUADAS (quality assessment for studies of diagnostic accuracy). Meta-Disc 1.4 and Stata 12.0 software were used to perform the meta-analysis. A high diagnostic accuracy was displayed, with a sensitivity of 0.84, a specificity of 0.88, a PLR of 7.20, a NLR of 0.18, a DOR of 52, and an AUC of 0.94. Subgroup analyses revealed better performance for combined miRNAs, acute myeloid leukemia patients and Asian population than other subgroups. Conclusion: Our analyses suggested that blood-based circulating miRNAs are promising diagnostic biomarkers for leukemia, especially combined miRNAs. Its clinical application awaits further study.},

The Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation were used to analyse biological functions of the biomarkers. AI classification techniques were utilized to further verify the significances of the multiple biomarkers in diagnosis and prognosis for CRC. We showed that a large number of the DNA, RNA and protein biomarkers were associated with the diagnosis, therapy and prognosis in various degrees in the CRC biomarker networks. The CRC biomarkers were closely related to the CRC initiation and progression. Moreover, the biomarkers played critical roles in cellular proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis and they were involved in Ras, p53 and PI3K pathways.

	abstract = {Background:

Retinal parameters could reflect systemic vascular changes. With the advances of deep learning technology, we have recently developed an algorithm to predict retinal age based on fundus images, which could be a novel biomarker for aging and mortality. Therefore, we aim to investigate associations of retinal age gap with arterial stiffness index and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Methods:

A deep learning model was trained based on 19 200 fundus images of 11 052 participants without any medical history at baseline to predict the retinal age. Retinal age gap (retinal age predicted minus chronological age) was generated for the remaining 35 917 participants. Regression models were used to assess the association between retinal age gap and arterial stiffness index. Cox proportional hazards regression models and restricted cubic splines were used to explore the association between retinal age gap and incident CVD.

Results:

We found each 1-year increase in retinal age gap was associated with increased arterial stiffness index (β=0.002 [95\% CI, 0.001–0.003]; P{\textless}0.001). After a median follow-up of 5.83 years (interquartile range: 5.73–5.97), 675 (2.00\%) developed CVD. In the fully adjusted model, each 1-year increase in retinal age gap was associated with a 3\% increase in the risk of incident CVD (hazard ratio=1.03 [95\% CI, 1.01–1.06]; P=0.014). In the restricted cubic splines analysis, the risk of incident CVD increased significantly when retinal age gap reached 1.21 (hazard ratio=1.05 [95\% CI, 1.00–1.10]; P-overall {\textless}0.0001; P-nonlinear=0.0681).

Conclusions:

We found that retinal age gap was significantly associated with arterial stiffness index and incident CVD events, supporting the potential of this novel biomarker in identifying individuals at high risk of future CVD events.},

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the major causes of cancer death worldwide. In general, early diagnosis for CRC and individual therapy have led to better survival for the cancer patients. Accumulating studies concerning biomarkers have provided positive evidence to improve cancer early diagnosis and better therapy. It is, however, still necessary to further investigate the precise biomarkers for cancer early diagnosis and precision therapy and predicting prognosis. In this study, AI-assisted systems with bioinformatics algorithm integrated with microarray and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) gene expression (GE) data has been approached to predict microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers for early diagnosis of CRC based on the miRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) interaction network. The relationships between the predicted miRNA biomarkers and other biological components were further analyzed on biological networks. Bayesian meta-analysis of diagnostic test was utilized to verify the diagnostic value of the miRNA candidate biomarkers and the combined multiple biomarkers. Biological function analysis was performed to detect the relationship of candidate miRNA biomarkers and identified biomarkers in pathways. Text mining was used to analyze the relationships of predicted miRNAs and their target genes with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Survival analyses were conducted to evaluate the prognostic values of these miRNAs in CRC. According to the number of miRNAs single regulated mRNAs (NSR) and the number of their regulated transcription factor gene percentage (TFP) on the miRNA-mRNA network, there were 12 promising miRNA biomarkers were selected. There were five potential candidate miRNAs (miRNA-186-5p, miRNA-10b-5, miRNA-30e-5p, miRNA-21 and miRNA-30e) were confirmed as CRC diagnostic biomarkers, and two of them (miRNA-21 and miRNA-30e) were previously reported. Furthermore, the combinations of the five candidate miRNAs biomarkers showed better prediction accuracy for CRC early diagnosis than the single miRNA biomarkers. miRNA-10b-5p and miRNA-30e-5p were associated with the 5-FU therapy resistance by targeting the related genes. These miRNAs biomarkers were not statistically associated with CRC prognosis.},

	abstract = {Differential expressions and functions of various micoRNAs (miRNAs) have been intensively studied in both colon and rectal cancers. However, the importance of miRNAs on radiotherapy (RT) response and clinical outcome in rectal cancer patients remains unclear. In this study, we used real-time polymerase chain reaction to examine the expressions of miR-302a, miR-105, and miR-888 in normal mucosa and cancer tissue from rectal cancer patients with and without preoperative RT. The biological function of miR-302a, miR-105, and miR-888 expression was further analyzed and identified through the public databases: TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) and GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis). The results showed that the expression of miR-105 in rectal cancer was higher than that in normal mucosa in RT (P = 0.042) and non-RT patients (P = 0.003) and was associated with mucinous histological type (P = 0.004), COX-2 (P = 0.042), and p73 expression (P = 0.030). The expression of miR-302a was shown more frequently in cancers with necrosis (P = 0.033) and with WRAP53 expression (P = 0.015), whereas miR-888 expression occurred more frequently in tumors with protein the expression of survivin (P = 0.015), AEG-1 (astrocyte elevated gene-1) (P = 0.003), and SATB1 (special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1) (P = 0.036). Moreover, TargetScan also predicted AEG-1 and SATB1 as putative targets for miR-888. The miRNA–gene network analysis showed that ABI2 was associated with all the three miRNAs, with lower expression and good diagnostic value in rectal cancers. The TCGA database demonstrated the association of miR-105 expression with high carcinoembryonic antigen level (P = 0.048). RT reduced the expressions of miR-302a, miR-105, and miR-888. Prognostic analysis showed that miR-888 expression was independently associated with worse survival of patients without RT [overall survival, P = 0.001; disease-free survival, P = 0.009]. Analysis of biological function revealed that the protein serine/threonine kinase activity and PI3K-AKT signaling pathway were the most significantly enriched functions and pathways, respectively. Our findings suggest that miR-105 is involved in rectal cancer pathogenesis and miR-888 is associated with prognosis. MiR-302a, miR-105, and miR-888 have potential influence on the pathogenesis, RT, and prognosis of rectal cancer.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a series of chronic diseases, which are associated with progressive loss of neuronal structure or function. The complex etiologies of the NDDs remain unclear, thus the prevention and early diagnosis of NDDs are critical to reducing the mortality and morbidity of these diseases.
Objectives
To provide a systematic understanding of the heterogeneity of the risk factors associated with different NDDs (pan-neurodegenerative diseases or pan-NDDs), the knowledgebase is established to facilitate the personalized and knowledge-guided diagnosis, prevention and prediction of NDDs.
Methods
Before data collection, the medical, lifescienceand informatics experts as well as the potential users of the database were consulted and discussed for the scope of data and the classification of risk factors. The PubMed database was used as the resource of the data and knowledge extraction. Risk factors of NDDs were manually collected from literature published between 1975 and 2020.
Results
The comprehensive risk factors database for NDDs (NDDRF) was established including 998 single or combined risk factors, 2293 records and 1071 articles relevant to the 14 most common NDDs. The single risk factors are classified into 3 categories, i.e. epidemiological factors (469), genetic factors (324) and biochemical factors (153). Among all the factors, 179 factors are positive and protective, while 880 factors have negative influence for NDDs. The knowledgebase is available at http://sysbio.org.cn/NDDRF/.
Conclusion
NDDRF provides the structured information and knowledge resource on risk factors of NDDs. It could benefit the future systematic and personalized investigation of pan-NDDs genesis and progression. Meanwhile it may be used for the future explainable artificial intelligence modeling for smart diagnosis and prevention of NDDs.},

	abstract = {BackgroundConsidered as the representatives of neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and glaucoma are complex progressive neuropathies affected by both genetic and environmental risk factors and cause irreversible damages. Current research indicates that there are common features between AD and glaucoma in terms of epidemiology and pathophysiology. However, the understandings and explanations of their comorbidity and potential genetic overlaps are still limited and insufficient.MethodGenetic pleiotropy analysis was performed using large genome-wide association studies summary statistics of AD and glaucoma, with an independent cohort of glaucoma for replication. Conditional and conjunctional false discovery rate methods were applied to identify the shared loci. Biological function and network analysis, as well as the expression level analysis were performed to investigate the significance of the shared genes.ResultsA significant positive genetic correlation between AD and glaucoma was identified, indicating that there were significant polygenetic overlaps. Forty-nine shared loci were identified and mapped to 11 shared protein-coding genes. Functional genomic analyses of the shared genes indicate their modulation of critical physiological processes in human cells, including those occurring in the mitochondria, nucleus, and cellular membranes. Most of the shared genes indicated a potential modulation of metabolic processes in human cells and tissues. Furthermore, human protein–protein interaction network analyses revealed that some of the shared genes, especially MTCH2, NDUFS3, and PTPMT1, as well as SPI1 and MYBPC3, may function concordantly. The modulation of their expressions may be related to metabolic dysfunction and pathogenic processes.ConclusionOur study identified a shared genetic architecture between AD and glaucoma, which may explain their shared features in epidemiology and pathophysiology. The potential involvement of these shared genes in molecular and cellular processes reflects the “inter-organ crosstalk” between AD and glaucoma. These results may serve as a genetic basis for the development of innovative and effective therapeutics for AD, glaucoma, and other neurodegenerative diseases.},

To investigate the relationship between visual impairment (VI) and dementia in the UK Biobank Study.
Design
Prospective cohort study.
Methods
A total of 117,187 volunteers (aged 40-69 years) deemed free of dementia at baseline were included. Habitual distance visual acuity worse than 0.3 logMAR units in the better-seeing eye was used to define VI. The incident dementia was based on electronically linked hospital inpatient and death records.
Results
During a median follow-up of 5.96 years, the presence of VI was significantly associated with incident dementia (hazard ratio: 1.78; 95\% confidence interval: 1.18-2.68; P = .006). There was a clear trend between the severity of VI and risk of dementia (P for trend = .002).
Conclusions
We found VI was associated with increased risk of dementia, with a progressively greater risk among those with worse visual acuity. Our findings suggested that VI might be a modifiable risk factor for dementia and highlighted the potential value of VI elimination to delay the manifestation of dementia.},

We aim to investigate the association of visual impairment (VI), hearing impairment (HI), and dual sensory impairment (DSI) with incident dementia.MethodsThe UK Biobank study recruited more than 500,000 participants aged 40–69 years across the United Kingdom. Participants with available visual acuity (VA) measurements and speech-reception-threshold (SRT) information and free of dementia at the baseline assessment were included in the analysis. VI was defined as VA worse than 0.3 LogMAR units and HI were defined as an SRT of −5.5 dB or over. DSI was defined as the presence of both VI and HI. Incident dementia was identified through linked data to primary care or hospital admission records and death registries. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine the association of VI, HI, and DSI with incident dementia.ResultsAmong 113,511 participants (mean age: 56.8 ± 8.09 years, female: 54.4\%), a total number of 1,135 (1.00\%) cases of incident dementia were identified during a median follow up period of 11.1 years [interquartile range (IQR): 10.9–11.4 years]. The incidence of dementia showed significant differences among the non-sensory impairment (NSI) group, VI-only group, HI-only group, and DSI group (p {\textless} 0.001). After adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, health, and genetic factors, isolated VI (HR = 1.50, 95\% CI: 1.06–2.12, p = 0.023), isolated HI (HR = 1.42, 95\% CI:1.20–1.69, p {\textless} 0.001), and DSI (HR = 1.82, 95\% CI: 1.10–3.00, p = 0.020) were independently associated with higher risks of incident dementia.ConclusionsVisual, hearing, and dual sensory impairments were associated with an increased risk of developing dementia, suggesting that visual and hearing impairments are modifiable risk factors that can be targeted to prevent dementia.},

	abstract = {Background. The incidence of colorectal cancers has been constantly increasing. Although the mortality has slightly decreased, it is far from satisfaction. Precise early diagnosis for colorectal cancer has been a great challenge in order to improve patient survival. Patients and Methods. We started with searching for protein biomarkers based on our colorectal cancer biomarker database (CBD), finding differential expressed genes (GEGs) and non-DEGs from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, and further predicted new biomarkers of protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks by machine learning (ML) methods. The best-selected biomarker was further verified by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) test from microarray and RNA-seq data, biological network, and functional analysis, and immunohistochemistry in the tissue arrays from 198 specimens. Results. There were twelve proteins (MYO5A, CHGA, MAPK13, VDAC1, CCNA2, YWHAZ, CDK5, GNB3, CAMK2G, MAPK10, SDC2, and ADCY5) which were predicted by ML as colon cancer candidate diagnosis biomarkers. These predicted biomarkers showed close relationships with reported biomarkers of the PPI network and shared some pathways. An ROC test showed the CHGA protein with the best diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.9 in microarray data and 0.995 in RNA-seq data) among these candidate protein biomarkers. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry examination on our colon cancer tissue microarray samples further confirmed our bioinformatical prediction, indicating that CHGA may be used as a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of colon cancer patients. Conclusions. CHGA could be a potential candidate biomarker for diagnosing earlier colon cancer in the patients.},

We studied the miRNA expression profile of primary CSCs isolated from patients with CRC (pCRCSCs). Compared to pCRCSC-derived differentiated cells, 98 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in pCRCSCs. Target genes encoding pCRCSC-related miRNAs were identified using a combination of miRNA target databases and miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks from the same patient. The pCRCSC-related miRNA target genes were associated with pathways contributing to malignant phenotypes, including I-kappa B kinase/NF-kappa B signaling, signal transduction by p53 class mediator, Ras signaling, and cGMP-PKG signaling. The pCRCSC-related miRNA expression signature was independently associated with poor overall survival in both the training and validation cohorts. We have thus identified several pCRCSC-related miRNAs with oncogenic potential that could serve as prognostic biomarkers for CRC.},

	abstract = {Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy, and the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. However, the early detection of glaucoma remains challenging as chronic forms of glaucoma remain largely asymptomatic until considerable irreversible visual field deficits have ensued. Thus, biomarkers that facilitate early diagnosis and treatment for patients with a high risk of progression are critical. Network medicine approaches can be useful in identifying key relationships and important biomolecules for complex diseases. In this paper, we identified several hub biomarkers/drug targets for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis for glaucoma and explored their associations for glaucoma based on human disease-biomarker and disease-target-drug networks. These results were verified by text-mining and genomic/epidemiology data. We also predicted the new application of BMP1 and MMP9 to diagnose glaucoma and confirm the theory of hub biomarkers with multiple clinical applications. Further, relevant pivotal pathways (regulation of the multicellular organismal process, regulation of localisation, and cytoplasmic vesicle for biomarkers; signal transduction and developmental process for targets) for these hub biomolecules were discovered, which may be foundations for future biomarker and drug target prediction for glaucoma. In conclusion, based on complex networks, hub biomolecules, essential pathways, and close diseases were identified for glaucoma in diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.},

	abstract = {Objective To investigate the association of visual impairment (VI) with brain structures in the UK Biobank Study.
Methods The UK Biobank Study is a large prospective study that recruited more than 500,000 participants aged 40-69 from 2006 to 2010 across the UK. Visual acuity (VA) of worse than 0.3 LogMAR units (Snellen 20/40) was defined as VI. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were obtained using a 3.0-T MRI imager. Volumetric measures of five global brain volumes (total brain volume, total grey matter, total white matter, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain stem) and the volumes of seven specific brain region (thalamus, caudate nucleus, basal ganglia, pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens) were included in the present analysis. Multivariable linear regression was used to investigate the association of VI with global and specific brain volumes.
Results A total of 8976 participants free of neurological disorders at baseline assessment were included for the present analysis. The prevalence of VI was 0.02\% (n=181). After adjusting for a range of cofounding factors, VI was significantly associated with decreased volumes of the total brain (β = -0.12, 95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.23 to 0.00, P = 0.049), thalamus (β = -0.16, 95\% CI -0.18 to -0.04, P = 0.010), caudatenucleus (β = -0.14, 95\% CI -0.27 to 0.00, P = 0.046), pallidum (β = -0.15, 95\% CI-0.27 to -0.02, P = 0.028) and amygdala (β = -0.18, 95\% CI -0.31 to -0.04, P = 0.012).
Interpretation We found that VI is associated with a decrease in total brain volumes and the volumes of specific brain regions implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.},

            Purpose:
            Radiotherapy (RT) is a standard adjuvant therapy in progressive rectal cancer patients
            ,
            but many patients are resistant to RT, leading to poor prognosis. Our study identified microRNA-652 (miR-652) value on RT response and outcome in rectal cancer patients.
            Methods:
            miR-652 expression was determined by RT-PCR in primary rectal cancer from 48 patients with and 53 patients without RT. The relationship of miR-652 with biological factors and prognosis were examined. The biological function of miR-652 was identified through TCGA and GEPIA database search. Two human colon cancer cell lines (HCT116 p53+/+ and p53-/-) were used for
            in vitro
            study.
            Results:
            miR-652 expression was augmented significantly in cancer than normal mucosa in non-RT patients (
            P
            =0.044). High miR-652 expression in non-RT patients was related to more apoptosis (
            P
            =0.036), ATM (
            P
            =0.010) and DNp73 expression (
            P
            =0.009). High miR-652 expression was related to worse disease-free survival of non-RT patients, independent of gender, age, tumor stage and differentiation (
            P
            =0.028; HR=7.398, 95\% CI 0.217-3.786). The biological functional analysis further identified the prognostic value and potential relationship of miR-652 with the apoptosis in rectal cancer. In RT patients, miR-652 expression was notably decreased in cancers when compared to non-RT cases (
            P
            =0.047), and miR-652 expression in cancers was negatively related to WRAP53 expression (
            P
            =0.022). After miR-652 inhibition, the estimation of reactive oxygen species, caspase activity and apoptosis in HCT116 p53+/+ cells were significantly increased compared with HCT116 p53-/- cells after radiation.
            Conclusions
            Our findings suggest the potential value of miR-652 expression as a marker for the prediction of radiation response and clinical outcome in rectal cancer patients.},

            We created a colorectal cancer (CRC) biomarker database (CBD) with credible content as a powerful and time-saving tool to provide better and accurate information concerning CRC biomarkers. CRC biomarker database (http://sysbio.suda.edu.cn/CBD/) was established based on 870 identified CRC biomarkers and their relevant information from 1115 original articles in PubMed published from 1986 to 2017. In this version of the CBD, CRC biomarker data was collected, sorted, displayed, and analysed. The CBD with the credible contents as a powerful and time-saving tool can provide more comprehensive and accurate information for further CRC biomarker researches. The CBD was constructed under MySQL server. HEML, PHP and JavaScript languages have been used to implement the web interface. The Apache was selected as HTTP server. All of these web operations were implemented under the Windows system. The CBD was concluded the multiple individual biomarker information and categorised into the biological category, source and application of biomarkers; the experiment methods, results, authors and publication resources; the research region, the patient's age, gender, race, the number of tumours, tumour location, and stage. The key words for searching in PubMed are: (((biomarker[Title/Abstract] OR marker[Title/Abstract]) OR indicator[Title/Abstract]) OR predictor[Title/Abstract]) AND ((colorectal cancer[Title/Abstract] OR rectal cancer[Title/Abstract]) OR bowel cancer[Title/Abstract]). The CBD can provide a professional platform to researchers who are interested in CRC research to communicate, exchange their research ideas and further design high quality research in CRC. They can submit their new findings to our database via th submission page, and communicate with us in the CBD.
